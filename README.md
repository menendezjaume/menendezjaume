ðŸŽ“ **Passionate Educator:**

As a professor and an advocate for knowledge sharing, I am deeply committed to the field of education. My goal is to not only impart technical skills but also to instill a sense of curiosity and innovation in future IT professionals. Through my teaching, I aim to inspire and guide the next generation of tech leaders, helping them to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of information technology.

ðŸ›¡ **Professional Journey in Security Engineering:**

With over 10 years of industry experience, my journey in security engineering has been both diverse and enriching. Having worked with start-ups like Aircall and Thought Machine, as well as in top-tier organizations, I've developed and enhanced numerous information security strategies. This period was instrumental in shaping my skills and understanding of the industry's dynamics. My expertise lies in cloud security, risk management, secure design, and leading bug bounty programs.

ðŸš€ **Entrepreneurial Endeavors:**

From 2017 to 2019, I embarked on an entrepreneurial path, starting my own company and working as a freelance security engineer. Later, in 2022, I founded aita.care, a venture close to my heart, aimed at supporting professionals with mental health challenges in the workplace. However, due to personal reasons, this chapter is coming to a close. This experience, though brief, has been incredibly valuable and a testament to my commitment to making a positive impact in the professional world.

ðŸ’¼ **Professional Highlights:**

- Experienced in leading and collaborating with interdisciplinary teams.
- Skilled in improving communication and operational efficiency in diverse settings.
- A strong advocate for continuous learning, as evidenced by my numerous industry certifications.

ðŸŒŸ **Current Focus:**

Currently, my primary focus is on education and nurturing the next wave of IT talent. I am dedicated to leveraging my experiences in security engineering and entrepreneurship to provide a holistic learning experience for my students. I believe in the power of education to transform lives and am committed to contributing to this transformative journey.
